Sky Commander is an arcade game about a new air traffic controller directing the
planes that land with increasing difficulty.

## Game Description

The game is centered on guiding or directing "traffic" through different airspaces or towards specific targets using two virtual lightsticks, each controlled separately. The player operates each lightstick through different input sets: the left one with WASD controls and the right with arrow keys. This introduces a unique challenge in coordination and precision as the player must manage both directional inputs to synchronize movement effectively.

# Unique Gameplay Features

Dual-Control Mechanic: Unlike most games where players control a single entity or group with unified controls, this game challenges players to independently coordinate two separate controls. This dual-input system is uncommon and requires a higher level of ambidexterity and spatial awareness.

Directional Signaling: Each lightstick's directional inputs will align with specific targets or "paths."

Increasing Complexity: As the game progresses the speed and direction increases and players might need to shift directions rapidly or deal with potential obstacles

Game Goal
The ultimate objective of the game could be to direct a certain number of aircraft to safe zones within a time limit or to avoid collisions as long as possible. Success might be measured by accuracy, time spent directing traffic, or the number of successful passes without any accidents.

How It Stands Out
This game emphasizes spatial coordination and dual-task management at a level uncommon in traditional games. It combines aspects of rhythm, real-time strategy, and reflex-based mechanics, making it suitable for players looking for a mentally stimulating and challenging experience. The innovative control scheme, along with a focus on coordination and timing, makes it distinctive from conventional single-controller or synchronized-input games.
